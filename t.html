   A <strong>cyclic redundancy check (CRC)</strong> is an error-detecting code commonly used in digital networks and storage devices to 
detect accidental changes to raw data. Blocks of data entering these systems get a short check value attached, based on the remainder of a 
polynomial division of their contents. On retrieval, the calculation is repeated and, in the event the check values do not match, corrective action can be taken against data corruption. CRCs can be used for error correction.

    CRCs are so called because the check (data verification) value is a redundancy (it expands the message without adding information) and the 
algorithm is based on cyclic codes. CRCs are popular because they are simple to implement in binary hardware, easy to analyze mathematically, and particularly good at detecting common errors caused by noise in transmission channels. Because the check value has a fixed length, the function that generates it is occasionally used as a hash function.

    The CRC was invented by W. Wesley Peterson in 1961; the 32-bit CRC function of Ethernet and many other standards is the work of several 
esearchers and was published in 1975.

	<strong> The various steps followed in the CRC method are</strong><br>

1. A string of n as is appended to the data unit. The length of predetermined divisor is n+ 1.<br>

2. The newly formed data unit i.e. original data + string of n as are divided by the divisor using binary division and remainder is obtained. <br>This remainder is called CRC.<br>

<br>
<br>3. Now, string of n Os appended to data unit is replaced by the CRC remainder (which is also of n bit).
<br>
4. The data unit + CRC is then transmitted to receiver.
<br>
5. The receiver on receiving it divides data unit + CRC by the same divisor and checks the remainder.
<br>
6. If the remainder of division is zero, receiver assumes that there is no error in data and it accepts it.
<br>
7. If remainder is non-zero then there is an error in data and receiver rejects it.
<br>
 For example, if data to be transmitted is 1001 and predetermined divisor is 1011. The procedure given below is used:
<br>
1. String of 3 zeroes is appended to 1011 as divisor is of 4 bits. Now newly formed data is 1011000.
<br>
                       
   <br>      
                          <img src="receiverside.jpg" alt="CRC checker at receiver side" width="500" height="300">
                         
<br>
1. Data unit 1011000 is divided by 1011.
<br>
 <br>      
                          <img src="generator.jpg" alt="CRC generated (Binary-division)" width="500" height="300">
                         
<br>
                                
<br>
2. During this process of division, whenever the leftmost bit of dividend or remainder is 0, we use a string of Os of same length as divisor.<br> Thus in this case divisor 1011 is replaced by 0000.
<br>
3. At the receiver side, data received is 1001110.
<br>
4. This data is again divided by a divisor 1011.
<br>
5. The remainder obtained is 000; it means there is no error.
<br>
                               <br>

<br> 

<br><br>
 CRC can detect all the burst errors that affect an odd number of bits.
<br>
 The probability of error detection and the types of detectable errors depends on the choice of divisor.
<br>
 Thus two major requirement of CRC are:
<br>
(a) CRC should have exactly one bit less than divisor.
<br>
(b) Appending the CRC to the end of the data unit should result in the bit sequence which is exactly divisib
