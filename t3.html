    <strong>1 bit error corection</strong> <p></p>
    The algorithm for error correcting CRCs involves determining the remainder after dividing in binary (modulo 2). The algorithm is table driven. The length of the message is determined, a priori, and agreed to by both the sender and the receiver. A generator polynomial value that can be used to determine the position of errors anywhere in the message is also selected at that time.

Before a message is sent, a checksum is calculated and appended onto the end of the message. The message and checksum are then sent. The receiver gets the message and calculates a second checksum (of both parts). If the new checksum value is 0 then the message is considered valid. If not, the checksum value is used as a subscript in an error correction table to determine the position of the bad bit. This method will find and correct 1-bit errors. The receiver builds the error correction table using the chosen Generator Polynomial (GP). The GP has to be carefully selected, because different GPs have different characteristics.    <p></p>
Building the Tables
To build the error correction table, I begin with a series of 0s representing correct data. One of the bits is then set to 1. Using modulo 2 division (exclusive-or), the receiver divides the message by the GP, calculating the remainder that is used as a subscript in the error correction table. See Algorithm 1.
<p></p>
Algorithm 1:
<pre>
for (i = 1; i<=Message_Length; i++)
  {
    set all bits in the Message to 0
    change the i'th bit to 1
    calculate the checksum (cs)
    EC_table[cs] = i
  }
</pre>

Building the EC Table for 1011
In the example that follows, I have chosen a 4-bit generator polynomial. With 4-bit GPs, only two GP values can be used for error correction--decimal values 11 and 13. I chose 11. When one divides the message by the 4-bit GP, the result is a 3-bit remainder, yielding values from 0 to 7. This result implies that I can use this GP for a message with a total length from 1 to 7 bits. (Four bits for the message and 3 bits for the checksum). The result of the calculation of the checksums is shown in Table 1. At the bottom of the table are the decimal values of the remainders after the division.

These values are then used to fill the Error Correction (EC) table. The EC table, in checksum order, is shown in Table 2. You could initialize an array in C with these values. Usually, EC[0] is not used.

int EC[] = {0,7,6,4,5,1,3,2};
Sending a Message with GP = 1011
Start with the following generator polynomial: 1011. Assume the Original Data is 1100. First append 3 additional bits (with value 000) on the end. Then calculate the checksum (using exclusive-or):
<pre>
1100000
1011
----
0111000
 1011
  ----
  1010
  1011
   ----
    010
</pre>
The resulting checksum is: 010 and the string that is sent is the original data appended with the checksum: 1100010. Suppose the following string of bits is received 1101010. (Numbering from left to right, bit 4 has changed.) The receiver computes the checksum.
<pre>
1101010
1011
----
01100
 1011
 ----
  1111
  1011
  ----
   1000
   1011
   ----
    011
</pre>
The checksum is binary 011, which is 3 in decimal. EC[3] is 4, which is the position of the bad bit! (Refer to Table 2) You can use this scheme for much longer messages, but the preceeding example demonstrates the essence of the algorithm. I wrote a program that determines whether a given bit pattern can be used as an error correcting GP . None of the existing widely used GPs work for error correction

 The following code is a slight modification of an algorithm presented by Fred Halsall for computing an 8-bit CRC.
<p></p>
Algorithm 2:
<pre>
    hpo2 = 8;
    v = 1;
    for (i = hpo2-1; i>=1; i--)
      {
        if (v == checksum)
          bad_bit_position = i;
        v = v + v;
        if (v >= hpo2) v = v ^ GP;
      }
